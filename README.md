Hello, my name is Luca Cero, and I am an incoming freshman at the University of Washington, who will be majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering, and am aiming to earn a second
degree, either in Computational Finance & Risk Management (CFRM) or Applied & Computational Math Sciences. My current interests are software/hardware development, and I am also
interested in mathematical finance. This is the second version of my Wind Loading of Structures program, where this time I implemented the ideas and concepts I learned in CSE 122. 
I implemented object oriented programming, data structures, file input/output, functional decomposition, and code commenting, all things that I learned in CSE 122. 
If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via my phone number ((206)-992-5803) or my email (lucaandcero@gmail.com). Thank you so much for viewing my program!
